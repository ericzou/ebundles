LaTeX and BibTeX Syntax Highlighting
By Eric Hsu, Normand Mousseau, Gaetan Le Guelvouit, Andrew Ellis,
   Sune Foldager, Brad Miller.

(2005-May-17) Things are a little more straightened out now. The main command for LaTeX is
'LaTeX and view', bound to F3. Several things can be configured using TM_LATEX_ prefixed env-vars:

MASTER      Relative path to the main LaTeX file to compile. Defaults to current file.
VIEWER      Program to view the compiled document. Defaults to 'html' which uses the TM html window.
COMPILER    Program to use for compiling the document. Defaults to pdflatex. Currently, the program
            you put here, must produce PDF output.
OPTIONS     Options to pass to the compiler defaults to: -interaction=nonstopmode
            -file-line-error-style.
ERRLVL      At what level do we assume an error occured. If the error level from the compiler is
            higher than this, the compile status window will be retained. Supported levels are:
            0: Ok (default).
            1: Warnings.
            2: Errors.

(1-4-05) This bundle has a tortured and confused history. Basically, a lot of people did parallel edits and it sort of got merged, kind of. Anyway, this is the latest version I have, which is the one included in TM 1.0.2. I fixed a bug with /( /) not being recognized as math mode, and added some commands, most notably a pdflatex command. TeXniscope is a great little previewer (thanks Jeroen van der Ham) at <http://docenti.ing.unipi.it/~d9615/homepage/texniscope.html>

Here are the old tangled notes from the old Wiki. 

(update) by Eric Hsu I updated the above LaTeX bundle by GLG to handle the case where you want a $ (\$) and to have a new command ‘Send to TeXShop’, which will have TeXShop open the file. If you set TS to ‘Configure for External Editor’, then it will automatically turn the .tex file into a PDF.

(another update) by Andrew Ellis I updated Eric’s bundle to include colouring for paragraphs, subequations, citet and citep (natbib), and generally changed the colouring. I also changed Gaetan’s Bibtex plist: it now calls itself Bibtex instead of Bibtext and no longer colours the @ in email addresses. There is also an ‘insert figure’ snippet, and commands for ‘comment/uncomment’ and ‘open in iTeXMac’ (I prefer it to TeXShop ;-)).

(bug corrections) By Gaetan Le Guelvouit I updated my initial highlighting scheme to take into account remarks from Eric and Andrew (i.e. \$, \citep and \citet, \paragraph, etc. in LaTeX files and @... in Bibtex). I also corrected some bugs:
	you can begin a new line with an inline equation ($...$),
	special caracter \% is no more considered as a comment beginning,
	non-numbered equations, i.e. $$...$$, are highlighted like inline equations.

(added snippets) By Normand Mousseau I have added a number of snippets to the bundle by Gaetan Le Guelvouit to generate structures such as equations, figures, tables, etc. To avoid conflict all the triggers start with a capital letter. (Corrected the bundle at 17:05)

(15/10/04) New version. I have also corrected the call to TexShop to allow for spaces (as done properly by Eric Hsu). Also added a return on the last line of the snippets to allow an exit of the structures using tab, to go with the latest beta of TextMate.
